    <h2>üîπ Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a professional with over 5 years of multidisciplinary experience, with strong performance in the Information Technology area and strategic roles in sectors such as web development, technical support, industrial automation, logistics, and customer service. My career is marked by adaptability, continuous learning, and delivering solid results, regardless of the work environment. I started my career as a Counter Attendant, where I learned the importance of organization, customer service, and teamwork. Then, I worked as a Network Support Technician at Giganet, performing technical functions such as connection projects, IP and subnet configuration, as well as Level 1 and 2 support, with an emphasis on data protection. Later, as a Web Developer, I delved into the front-end and back-end universe using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, Python (OOP), Laravel, C#, C++, WordPress, Bootstrap, and Linux, delivering functional and responsive solutions for digital projects. Expanding my role to the industrial sector, I was an Automation Mechanic at Grafit, where I performed system integration activities, preventive and corrective maintenance, and development of automated products. More recently, I worked as an Access Controller and currently work as a Checker / Storekeeper at Coopercitrus, dealing with inventory control, receipt of goods, batch control, and logistical organization.</p>
